# Deployment Trigger

This file was created to trigger a new Vercel deployment.

Created: 2025-08-14 19:30 PDT
Updated: 2025-08-14 19:35 PDT - Fixed vercel.json schema validation error

## Why This File Exists

Vercel sometimes doesn't detect small changes to existing files. Adding a new file should force a deployment.

## Current Status

- Transcription pipeline: ✅ Implemented
- Job queue system: ✅ Ready
- Vercel cron jobs: ✅ Configured (fixed schema validation)
- Cloudflare Stream integration: ✅ Complete
- Deepgram webhook: ✅ Ready

## Next Steps

1. Verify deployment appears in Vercel dashboard
2. Test transcription pipeline
3. Configure Deepgram webhook URL
4. Monitor cron job execution

## Recent Fixes

- Removed invalid `comment` property from vercel.json
- Cron job configuration now valid
